Now that you have a GitHub repository, it's now time to share your work with the world.  GitHub pages offers a no-cost coding-optional way to publish your work to the internet.   

1) In your repository, click on the settings icon.

2) Scroll down to the section for GitHub Pages

3) Change the `Source` box from `none` to `master branch`.  If you'd like to keep the published parts of your repository separated from other contents, you can select `master branch /docs folder` and only content in the docs folder will be published.

4) That's it.  Your content is now live on the web at <your user or organization name>.github.io/<your repository name> 
5) If you own a domain name, you can use it as well (see [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)).
6) To change the appearance of your content, to add navigation and other features, you can select a theme.  There are several built in to GitHub.  Try them out.  We'll share more options with you in a later section on purpose-built themes.
