# GitHub Pages Workshop

In this brief workshop, participants will be introduced to Github Pages , ["a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) to create a static site. In addition to HTML, CSS and to a lesser extent JavaScript, we will also be looking at a couple of other tools and concepts that crucial to understand GH pages such as Markdown, Git and the concept of minimal computing. At the end of these workshop, participants will:

- Learn how to set up a GitHub Pages site
- Learn how to add content to the site
- Learn how to edit and modify the theme of the site
- Lear how to add collaborators to the repository
- Undersatand the concepts of static and dynamic websites and minimal computing.


## Why learn GitHub Pages?

Github pages offers a robust ecosystem on wich to create a site that both follow the ethos of collaboration and minimal computing. Alhtough Content Managment Systems (CMS) like Omeka and Wordpress are also viable alternatives for website development, they require substantial local infrastructure to set up and can prohibit wide adoption.
