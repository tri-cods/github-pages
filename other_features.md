## Other Useful Features

### Projects

Github projects is a useful tool for organizing work around a repository. It uses a "board" and "card" visual interface for creating to-do lists, assigning tasks, and updating team members on progress.

The projects feature also has a few templates to start you off. For example, the "kanban" template creates a "to-do," "in progress," and "complete" column. In the example below, I've repurposed this template to build a course reading list in a collaborative project...

### Issues

Issues help you keep track of project bugs, broken links, etc.

### Wiki

The Github Wiki feature lets your collaborators write additional documentation around your project, providing valuable context. It's a great way to record and communicate the project history, background, use cases, etc. It also has a nice WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor for markdown!
