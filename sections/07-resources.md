# Resources for Exploring GitHub Pages

## Going further with GitHub Pages

If you are interested in going expanding your skills to go further with GitHub Pages, here are a few options you might explore on your own.

### Use a theme as a repository template

Some Jekyll themes are packaged as GitHub templates, so you can quickly create a new site based off the old one. This is a good option if you want features from a more complicated theme that's not one of the GitHub Pages Supported Themes. 

For example, the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme is a popular and versatile one. If you visit the repository for their [Minimal Mistakes GitHub Pages Starter Site](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) and click on 'Use this Template', you can quickly set up a full-fetured site and customize it as we've been doing.

### Install Jekyll for local development

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the website builder that powers GitHub Pages. If you want to do a lot of customization and preview your site more quickly and before you publish, you may decide to develop your site locally on your computer by installing Jekyll. This will require some troubleshooting and using the Command Line. See [Jekyll's quickstart guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to get a sense of what you'll need. The installation guide for [Collection Builder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/) can also be very helpful, even if you aren't using it as a template.
