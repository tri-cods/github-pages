# Deploying a GitHub Pages Site

## Edit the README

Right now your repository is empty except for a file called "README.md". This is the main documentation page for your project, but it will also be the default text for your GitHub Pages website. If you scroll down to this file, use the pencil icon to edit it. Below the existing text, type a sentence or two. If you need suggestions, you can always use `Hello World!`

Once you've added some text, you will want to 'save' your changes by using the "Commit changes" button. Enter a message that describes the change you just made.

## Activate Pages

Now that you have a GitHub repository, it's now time to share your work with the world.  GitHub pages offers a no-cost coding-optional way to publish your work to the internet.   

1) In your repository, Navigate to the "Settings" tab.

1) That's it. Your site is ready to deploy! Be patient, because it may take a few minutes to build.

## Add collaborators

- Select "Add Collaborators"

## Your new site's url

- Navigate back to the "Code" tab.
- Edit your "about" details: include a short description
- Under "Website", select "use GitHub Pages URL"
- Save your changes

Now you'll notice that a url has appeared. 

After your 'commit' history, you'll see a yellow dot that indicates your site is in the process of deploying. Once the dot becomes a green check mark, navigate to your URL.
