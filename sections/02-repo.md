## Create a Github account

To begin with:
You will need to have an account with GitHub.  It's free to sign up and to use.  
Go to [Github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and enter your information.

## Create a repository

To create a new repository, log in to Github with the account that you created above and click on the plus button in the upper right corner. Select "New repository":

You should see a form similar to the one below.

* Enter a name for your repository.  I find it helpful to think of this as the your project's web address or title.  Any spaces in the project name will automatically be filled with at hyphen ("my project" becomes "my-project").

- **Public** vs. **Private**: choose to make the repository visible to anyone or visible only to your collaborators. Because we will be using GitHub Pages to publish websites, choose "public".
* Click on the box to **Initialize this repository with a README**

* It is good practice to add a license for any content. The defaults options when creating a repository are designed for open source software.  They ensure the rights of coders to share and alter each other's code. The option that is most like a traditional copyright for scholarship is Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).  This license does not allow the distribution, alteration or commercial use of your content. You can add this license by pasting the following into your README file: `[![License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC--ND%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)`

## An orientation

So, let's take a look at your repository. If you scroll down, you'll see a list of files and folders within your repository. Currently, your repository is empty except for a file called "README.md". On the same line as the filename, you'll see a message and a timestamp: this indicates the last time this file was edited and the editor's description of their changes.

If you continue scrolling down, you'll notice that the contents of the README.md file also appear on the main page of your repository. You'll probably see the repository name and no other text.

## Edit the README

The README file is the main documentation page for your project and developers use it to provide context about their project and sometimes instructions for how to use their code, but it will also be the default text for your GitHub Pages website, so let's add some text.

Use the pencil icon on the right to edit this file. You'll notice that this looks different from a traditional text editor and that there's no formatting menu: that's because it's a markdown editor (in fact, the file extension .md is a markdown file). You can add formatting using [markdown syntax as described here]

Below the existing text, type a sentence or two. If you need suggestions, you can always use `Hello World!`

Once you've added some text, you will want to 'save' your changes by using the "Commit changes" button. Enter a message that describes the change you just made.
